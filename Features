The new macOS Monterey is out for everyone. There are a lot of changes in the update. 
Maps, Safari browser, Universal Control and more. In general, working within the ecosystem has now become even more convenient. 
It is noteworthy that some of the functions are borrowed from iOS. In general, the operating system has become even clearer, simpler and more convenient. 
Obviously, there will be problems, because any update is a lottery, where you never know how the computer will behave. But, in my opinion, this is not a reason to abandon macOS, the innovations are definitely worth updating.
